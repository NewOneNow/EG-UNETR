Liver tumor segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, which plays a significant role in liver cancer diagnosis and later treatment planning. However, liver tumor segmentation faces several challenges, such as misunderstanding of blurred tumor edges and over-segmentation of small samples. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel edge-guided liver tumor segmentation network based on cross-level interactive Transformer, termed EG-UNETR. Specifically, three novel modules are introduced, i.e., the TransBridge (TB) module, the feature semantic enhancement (FSE) module, and the edge-guided block (EGB) module. Firstly, the TB module is designed to fuse the multi-scale features and eliminate irrelevant information. TB module consists of a position-aware Attention (PA) and a Fusion Attention (FA) which can capture and integrate richer cross-level and long-range contextual information simultaneously. Considering the computational cost, an extra light TransBridge (LTB) module is also designed to tackle the encoding features with higher-resolution. Secondly, the FSE module based on parallel dilation convolutions and hybrid attention mechanisms is developed to generate the comprehensive multi-scale semantic features. In addition, a powerful Non-local block (NLB) is introduced to align and refine these multi-scale semantic features. Thirdly, to address the issue of blurring edges in the liver tumor segmentation tasks, an EGB module is designed to refine the edges of complex tumors and achieve the fine-grained segmentation performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive experiments are conducted on the LiTS2017 dataset and the 3D-IRCADb dataset. Experimental results indicate that the proposed EG-UNETR outperforms other state-of-the-art comparison methods with five common evaluative metrics.
